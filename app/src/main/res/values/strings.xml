    <string name="tv_detail">Nicknamed the Swiss cheese plant and commonly known as Monstera Deliciosa, our \'Chaz\' is
        very on trend. But, that\'s not all. This plant is one of the easiest around to care for and, thanks to its
        unique foliage, one of our favourites too. He\'s supported by a moss pole to help keep him proudly upright.
